For assignments 2-4, you will need to use JAGS to answer some of the questions. Here are the steps to do this:

- Go to this: [URL](http://54.201.228.108/) Make sure to use a normal sized screen and a relatively recent browser.
- Create an account **where your username is your student id** (if your id is not in our database for some reason, just send us a private message in Piazza).
- Once you are logged in, look at the ``tutorials`` to get familiar with JAGS and the online tool. 
- Then go in the assignment tab and start by clicking ``Take assignment``. **Use the black arrows to navigate.** You will find more instruction there-in.
