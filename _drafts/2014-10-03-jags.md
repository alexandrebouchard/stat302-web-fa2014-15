For assignments 2-4, you will need to use JAGS to answer some of the questions. Here are the steps to do this:

- Go to this: [URL](http://54.201.228.108/) Make sure to use a standard laptop-sized screen and a relatively recent browser.
- Create an account **where your username should be your student id** (if your student id is not in our database for some reason, send us a private message in Piazza). Note: do not use the same password as you use for important services, since it is not encrypted.
- Once you are logged in, look at the ``tutorials`` to get familiar with JAGS and the online tool. 
- Then go in the assignment tab and start by clicking ``Take assignment``. **Click on one of the black arrows to start the assignment (they all lead to the same resources in this assignment).**
- **Make sure you click on ``Commit`` often to save your work!**


In case you are curious, more advanced, optional information on JAGS is available at this address: [blue.for.msu.edu/CSTAT_13/jags_user_manual.pdf](http://blue.for.msu.edu/CSTAT_13/jags_user_manual.pdf).
