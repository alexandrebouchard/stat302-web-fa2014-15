A few clarifications or errata in assignment 1:

- The notation $d\_{c,a}$ in 5.2 was originally incorrectly written as $d\_{a,c}$. This should not lead to confusion as the letters {T, C} and {W,A} are all distinct, but the typo was fixed on Sep 17, 19:00. 
- The word 'second component' was originally incorrectly written as 'denominator'. This was corrected on Sep 17, 16:00.
