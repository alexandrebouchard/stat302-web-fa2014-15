title: "Note regarding webwork announcements"
---

Note that for the remainder of the semester, individual announcements for the release of webwork problems will be done in the lecture slides (first few slides covering logistics). Make sure you look at these regularly. 

The link to webwork will always be: [here](https://webwork.elearning.ubc.ca/webwork2/STAT302-101_2014W1/)

Also, keep in mind that if you encounter problems:

- If it is a technical problem, please use the feedback system built-in webwork.
- If it is a conceptual problem, please use piazza (see link under ``Contact``).
