**Studying suggestions:**

- Read carefully the assignment solutions
- Same for the Webwork solutions (available in webwork)
- Definition and properties: what they mean, and their precise statement
- Do some exercises from the textbook (see suggested list to pick from under ``Syllabus`` tab, partial solutions made by another instructor available under ``Files``, ``ch1solns.pdf`` - ``ch4solns.pdf``)
- Try to do previous year exam in 50 minutes after studying but before Monday (skip Q1(a))
