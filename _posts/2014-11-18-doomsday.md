**Variables (interpretation 1):**

- $Z$: length of the measuring tape
- $Y$: random point on the measuring tape

**Variables (interpretation 2):**

- $Z$: Total number of humans to ever live, future and past (in trillion)
- $Y$: Number of humans that were born before present (from archeological records, ~0.06 trillion)

**Model:**

- $Z \sim \textrm{Unif}(0, 5)$
- $Y | Z \sim \textrm{Unif}(0, Z)$

**From last time:** The joint density is $$f(y, z) = \frac{\1\_{(0,5)}(z)}{5} \frac{\1\_{(0,z)}(y)}{z}$$

**Next questions:**

- Compute the marginal of $Y$, $f\_Y(y)$.
- Compute the posterior density $f\_{Z|Y}(z|y)$. 
- Plug-in $y=0.06$ in your expression of the posterior density.
- Compute the conditional expectation: $$E[Z|Y] = \int\_{-\infty}^{\infty} z f\_{Z|Y}(z|Y) \textrm{d}z$$
- Plug-in $y=0.06$ in your expression of the conditional expectation.

**Extra, optional questions:**

- Use JAGS to check your answers (see separate post on the website (`doomsday-jags`) accessible from the course webpage, `http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~bouchard/courses/stat302-fa2014-15/index.html`) for more guidance.
- Setup the integral to compute $E[Y]$ and $\textrm{Var}[Y]$.
